## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybinds

Like modal text editors such as Vim, there are several modes. Each have their own keybinds, which can be found out by pressing `F1` or `?` while in that mode. Some of the important ones are:

- <kbd>hjkl</kbd> or arrow keys for general navigation
- <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>i</kbd> to search
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>s</kbd> to change sources
- <kbd>d</kbd> to change download client
- <kbd>c</kbd> to change category
- <kbd>s</kbd> to change sort (<kbd>S</kbd> for reverse sort)
- <kbd>f</kbd> to change filter
- <kbd>t</kbd> to change theme
- <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd>, <kbd>h</kbd> for next and previous page
- <kbd>q</kbd> to quit

For a list of all modes and their respective keybinds, check [Keybinds](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki/Keybinds) on the wiki.

## üåê Proxies

If either `nyaa.si` or `torrentgalaxy` is not accessible in your region, try one of the proxies ([nyaa proxies](https://nyaatorrents.info/#proxy), [TorrentGalaxy proxies](https://torrends.to/proxy/torrentgalaxy)). Once you find one that works, replace the value for `base_url` in the source config with the working proxy url. For `nyaa`, I would recommend `nyaa.land`, as it is very compatible, and usually working. Here's what the config for `nyaa.land` would look like:

```toml
[source.nyaa]
base_url = 'nyaa.land'
```

If you have your own proxy setup, you use it by adding:

```toml
request_proxy = "localhost:8118"
```

to the top of your config. Replace the value with the IP and port for your proxy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The location of the config file for linux is:

`~/.config/nyaa/config.toml`

and on windows is

`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\nyaa\config\config.toml`

```toml
theme = "Default"
default_source = "Nyaa"
download_client = "Cmd"
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" # Unset by default
request_proxy = "localhost:8118" # Unset by default
timeout = 30 # Timeout for requests, measured in seconds

[source.nyaa]
...

[source.torrentgalaxy]
...

[client.cmd]
...

# ...
```

- `theme` refers to the theme selected by default when the app is opened. Possible values are `Default`, `Dracula`, `Gruvbox`, or `Catppuccin Macchiato`. Custom themes coming soon!

- `default_source` refers to the source selected by default once the app is opened. Possible values are `Nyaa`, `TorrentGalaxy`, or `Sukebei`.
  - Each source has its own configuration. Check the [wiki]() for more information on each sources config.

- `download_client` refers to the download client selected by default once the app is opened.
  - Each download client has its own configuration. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki#download-clients) for more information on each download clients config.

- `date_format` refers to the formatting of the dates in the Date column of the results table. Refer to [chrono's documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html) for information on how to format the date.

- `request_proxy` refers to the url to proxy request through. This is not to be confused with _nyaa_ proxies, which are defined with `base_url`.

- `timeout` refers to how long the program will wait for a search request before it times out. This value is measured in seconds. You may want to increase this if your request times are usually long.
