# Open with Default App Configuration
This "client" only opens the selected items magnet link using your default application.

## Default config
If you've selected "default_app" as your default download client, you will find this towards the bottom of your config (with only the required values present). This client has no values as of now.
```toml
# Your config in ~/.config/nyaa/config.toml or %appdata%\nyaa\config\config.toml
# ...
default_client = "default_app"
# ...

[client.default_app]
use_magnet = true # optional, true by default
```
